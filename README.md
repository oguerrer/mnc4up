# Computer Code of Figures
### Prepared by Omar A. Guerrero

This repository provides the code to replicate the figures of the paper: [Understanding Unemployment in the Era of Big Data: Policy Informed by Data-Driven Theory](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2716264). The code is in the Python programming language and uses the Jupyter Notebooks for pedagogical purposes. If you want to run the code you need to install the [Acaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python 2.7 in your computer. Then, download the notebook that you want to run. Finally, fire up the ipython-notebook from the Anaconda Launcher and laod the notebook that you just downloaded (it should have extension .ipynb).
